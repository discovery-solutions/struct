# @discovery-solutions/struct

A structured framework for building **forms, CRUDs, and admin interfaces** with **Next.js, React Hook Form, Zod, TanStack Query, and TailwindCSS**.
The goal is to provide a consistent way to define UI elements and data workflows while keeping the UI layer customizable through an injected `StructUIProvider`.
